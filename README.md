# novel_star_state_decompositions

This repository is part of my [Maturit√§tsarbeit](https://github.com/Tix3Dev/Maturitaetsarbeit).

It contains a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Tix3Dev/novel_star_state_decompositions/blob/main/all_decomps_demo.ipynb) to check the novel state decompositions. The diagrams were obtained using [cliffs](https://github.com/tuomas56/cliffs), and the coefficients
were found using the Jupter notebooks/Mathematica files found in the subdirectories.
