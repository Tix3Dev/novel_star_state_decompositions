# novel_star_state_decompositions

This repository is part of my [Maturit√§tsarbeit](https://github.com/Tix3Dev/Maturitaetsarbeit).

It contains a [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Tix3Dev/novel_star_state_decompositions/blob/main/all_decomps_demo.ipynb) to check the novel state decompositions. The diagrams were obtained using [cliffs](https://github.com/tuomas56/cliffs), and the coefficients
were found using the Jupter notebooks/Mathematica files found in the subdirectories. Finally, it contains parts of the source code used in ["Speedy Contraction of ZX Diagrams with Triangles via Stabiliser Decompositions"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01803).
